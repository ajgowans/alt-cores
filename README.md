# The MiSTer Database For Alternative Versions Of Core 

This is a database for the MiSTer project that downloads alternative versions of several cores that contain features not found in the main version.  These cores are added to the "Other" folder.

To use it simply copy and paste the below to the bottom of your downloader.ini file (found at: /media/fat/downloader.ini )

```ini
[ajgowans/alt-cores]
db_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajgowans/alt-cores/db/db.json.zip
```

 ## Currently Included Cores

 Sega Genesis +
 
 Playstation Turbo
 
 Nintendo 64 Turbo

 NeoGeo Turbo

  ## Additional Information
  
  Treat this database as an "Isle of Misfit Toys." These cores have either been deprecated in favor of more accurate versions, or are overclocked in order to mitigate slowdown in games on their respective systems. They are not under active development and are being made available only because folks (in some instances) prefer them.
